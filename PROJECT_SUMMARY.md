## üß† AI Solvability Algorithm

### Core Algorithm Implementation
The solvability checker uses advanced mathematical principles:

**For Odd-Sized Puzzles (3√ó3, 5√ó5, etc.)**
- Count inversions in flattened puzzle (excluding blank tile)
- Puzzle is solvable if inversions are even

**For Even-Sized Puzzles (4√ó4, 6√ó6, etc.)**
- Count inversions + blank tile position from bottom
- Puzzle is solvable if (inversions + blank_from_bottom) is odd

**Automatic Correction**
- If puzzle is unsolvable, algorithm swaps two non-blank tiles
- Ensures 100% solvability without manual intervention
