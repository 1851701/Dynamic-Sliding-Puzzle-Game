- **3D Graphics**: RealityKit (for future AR features)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with ObservableObject
- **Animations**: SwiftUI native animations with spring physics

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Launch the app** and select your difficulty level
2. **Tap adjacent tiles** to move them into the empty space
3. **Arrange tiles** in numerical order (1, 2, 3, ...) with the empty space in the bottom-right
4. **Track your progress** with the move counter and timer
5. **Celebrate** when you solve the puzzle!

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- iOS 15.0+ or macOS 12.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Dynamic Sliding Puzzle Game.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Select your target device/simulator
4. Build and run the project

## üß† AI Solvability Algorithm

The game uses a sophisticated algorithm to ensure every puzzle is solvable:

### For Odd-Sized Puzzles (3√ó3, 5√ó5, etc.)
- Count inversions in the flattened puzzle (excluding blank tile)
- Puzzle is solvable if inversions are even

### For Even-Sized Puzzles (4√ó4, 6√ó6, etc.)
- Count inversions + blank tile position from bottom
- Puzzle is solvable if (inversions + blank_from_bottom) is odd

### Automatic Correction
- If a puzzle is unsolvable, the algorithm automatically swaps two non-blank tiles
- This ensures 100% solvability without manual intervention

## üéØ Future Extensions

### Educational Applications
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Show solving strategies step-by-step
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Teach matrix operations and parity logic
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop logical thinking and pattern recognition
